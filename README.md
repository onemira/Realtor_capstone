My capstone project is to build a business website for my mother in law.
She works as a realtor in Los Angeles area and has been seeking to have her own website for her clients.  
This will be my dedication for somebody who has been offering great support in many ways since I moved to the US as my first building commercial website as a developer.

The website will consist of 5 sections:
-Title
-Profile
-Listings
-Sold properties
-Contact

It will be built as SPA in React using React Router. Each detail will be shown once clicked. She will be able to CDUR the listings on her own side by using API that I will create.
